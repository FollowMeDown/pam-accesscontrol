           What's new in pam-accesscontrol 0.96 ?
          ---------------------------------------

* No preconfigurations anymore.

Up to version 0.95, pam-accesscontrol set itself up during 
installation process. In some cases it were useful, but more 
intellingent way is to let users configure it as they want of course. 
That is what were added in version 0.96. Configuration should happen 
now via new 'management tool' called /sbin/pam-accesscontrol.

It was also not the best idea to point some groups of services from 
configuration file to some specific /etc/pam.d/* file. For example, 
up to version 0.95 it was possible to configure so called XDM 
service. XDM implied service that points to all supported display 
managers... First of all, we're going to support all display 
managers, right? :) So, why we need to define some limited list of 
services? Second, how about unfamiliar display managers (they can be, 
for example, still be not official released)?

First fixed problem here: after installing next display/login 
manager, reconfiguration of pam-accesscontrol is posible and it goes 
in easy way. "Easy" is exactly what I would like to feel by using 
pam-accesscontrol.

Second fixed problem here: I think, user is smart enough to figure 
out how PAM works and configure only services it need. Refusal of 
autoconfiguration and adding management tool make it possible.

* SSH public key authentication support.

Yes, we did it! Now it's possible to create SSH service for password- 
or public key authentication :) By using ASK option the notification 
window will also inform you about used authentication method: 
SSHD-KEY ASK USER SOMEONE.

* Support for primary groups is also there.

getent(1) doesn't show user's primary group. That sad, and 
unfortuantly pam-accesscontrol used it as a backend tool to get list 
of groups. Used it up to version 0.95, but not anymore...

* Pam-python packages for CentOS/RedHat users.

As you know, there are no public pam-python RPM packages. It made it 
hard to use pam-accesscontrol on these platforms. Now 
"pam-accesscontrol project" provides pam-python packages for everyone 
who want/should use this distribution.

* NEWS file

It seems you get it already. Yes, from now news for every new release 
will be in the NEWS files. So you will always be up to date with the 
latest news ;-)
