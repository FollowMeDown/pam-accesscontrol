           What's new in pam-accesscontrol 0.96 ?
          ---------------------------------------

* No preconfigurations anymore.

Up to version 0.95 pam-accesscontrol sets itself up during
installation process. In some cases it was useful, but more
intellingent way is to let users configure it as they want of course.
That is what was added in version 0.96. Configuration should happen
now via new management tool called /sbin/pam-accesscontrol.

$ ls -la /sbin/pam-accesscontrol
-r-x------ 1 root root 8841 Sep 10 18:15 /sbin/pam-accesscontrol


It was also not the best idea to point some groups of services from 
configuration file to some specific /etc/pam.d/* file. For example, 
up to version 0.95 it was possible to configure so called XDM 
service. XDM implied service that points to all supported display 
managers... First of all, we're going to support all display 
managers, right? :) So, why we need to define some limited list of 
services? Second, how about unfamiliar display managers (they can be, 
for example, still be not official released)?

After installing next display/login manager (or just some new server),
reconfiguration of pam-accesscontrol is posible and it goes in easy
way. "Easy" is exactly what I would like to feel by using
pam-accesscontrol.

I think, user is smart enough to figure out how PAM works and
configure only needed services. Refusal of autoconfiguration and
adding management tool make it possible.

* SSH public key authentication support.

Yes, we did it! Now it's possible to create SSH service for password- 
OR public key authentication :) By using 'ask' option notification
window will also inform X-session owner about used authentication
method:
SSHD-KEY ASK USER SOMEONE.

* Support for primary groups is also there.

getent(1) doesn't show user's primary group. That sad, and 
unfortuantly pam-accesscontrol used it as a backend tool to get list 
of user's groups. Used it up to version 0.95, but not anymore...

* Pam-python packages for CentOS/RedHat users.

As you know, there are no public pam-python RPM packages. It made it 
hard to use pam-accesscontrol on these platforms. Now 
"pam-accesscontrol project" provides pam-python packages for everyone 
who want/should use this distribution.

* NEWS file

It seems you get it already. Yes, from now news for every new release 
will be in the NEWS files. So you will always be up to date with the 
latest news ;-)
