           What's new in pam-accesscontrol 0.98 ?
          ---------------------------------------

* New pam-python version

Rebuild and tested with the new pam-python version - 1.0.7.


* Two-factor authentication

Since version 0.98 pam-accesscontrol can send auto generated
one time PIN via email. This PIN should be used for as a 2FA
for SSH authentification.


* PKI

Now our little baby knows what is GPG and will use public gpg
keys for the email encryption (PINs used for 2FA could be also
encrypted by using public gpg-keys).
