           What's new in pam-accesscontrol 0.97 ?
          ---------------------------------------

* Mail notification

Yes, we did it! Since version 0.97 it's possible to send mail
notification to specific addresses each time when someone logged in
via specified service. We added for that a new separate config file:
mail-notification.conf. More info could be found in the appropriate
manpage.


* GUI conformation for all PAM services.

Window notification supports now all PAM services. So you can use ASK
option not only for SSH.


* Support new distros and architectures.

New distros in the list of supported GNU/Linux systems. Enjoy!
- Fedora_29 (i586, x86_64, aarch64, ppc64le)
- Fedora_Rawhide (x84_64, aarch64)
- xUbuntu_18.10 (x86_64)
- Debian_9 (aarch64)
- CentOS_7 (aarch64)
- openSUSE_Factory (ppc64, aarch64)


* pam-accesscontrol(8)

Our cool configuration tool - pam-accesscontrol(8) - bekommes even
more checks. By the way, we moved it to the /usr/sbin directory.


* SLiM & LXDM

We're also have some progress with display manager support. SLiM and
LXDM are in the list of the official supported display managers.


* New commiter/developer
 
And the last one, but is also very important news!
New commiter - Oleg Paul - joined developers team. This collaboration
has already brought a lot of python changes/fixes, so I see already
that development process will continue even more intense pace and in
different directions. Welcome Oleg! Enjoy PAM hacking with Python ;-)
